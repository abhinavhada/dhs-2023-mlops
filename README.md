A repository containing workshop material used during **DataHack Summit 2023**, organized by **Analytics Vidhya**, for the workshop titled **Mastering MLOps – The Art of Productionalizing ML Models**.

## Workshop Details

Machine Learning has become an integral part of businesses across all industries, from healthcare and finance to retail and manufacturing. However, developing and deploying Machine Learning models at scale can be a complex and challenging task. This is where Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) comes in. MLOps is an emerging field that aims to streamline the process of developing and deploying Machine Learning models by applying DevOps principles to Machine Learning workflows.

Throughout this 8-hour comprehensive workshop, we’ll guide you into the evolving realm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). We’ll delve into a deep understanding of its architecture, demonstrating the blueprint for successful implementation. We’ll shed light on its practical applications, demonstrating hands-on exercises with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision models. Emphasizing on practical knowledge, we will cover the deployment of MLOps using these data models, intended to bolster your productivity. Additionally, we’ll ensure you’re equipped with an MLOps toolkit, knowledge to pick the right platform, and are aware of the standard best practices for MLOps mastery. The workshop also aims to bust myths associated with MLOps, providing a comprehensive and clear understanding of this important field.
